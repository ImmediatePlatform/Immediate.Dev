# Immediate.Dev

Public website for the ImmediatePlatform, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

After installing node.js (version 23 is recommended), enable `yarn` by running `corepack enable`.

Once you've installed dependencies with `yarn install`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production build run:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> Deployment uses [@sveltejs/adapter-static](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters).
